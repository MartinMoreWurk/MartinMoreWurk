### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AERE 361 and graduating ISU.
- My hobbies are gaming and gardening. 
- I want to learn more about coding in general and specifically I want to understand for loops better. But learning about coding will be strictly career based, because it doesn't interest me much. 
- I am very interested in learning about supersonic hypersonic flows. 
- My favorite aircraft is the Lockheed-Martin SR-71 Blackbird.
